    ExecutorService Interface -
        ExecutorService is an interface (which extends Executor class) that provides methods for managing and controlling threads efficiently.
        It helps you create, schedule, and execute tasks asynchronously
        (without waiting for each task to finish before starting the next)

        Handles thread creation and reuse, so you donâ€™t need to manage threads manually.
        Allows you to submit tasks for execution (Runnable or Callable).
        Provides methods to shut down the thread immediately.
        Allows you to track the progress of a submitted task and retrieve its result

    EXECUTORS -
       Executors is a class that helps to create and manage a group of threads.
       Instead of creating and managing threads manually, Executors handle the thread, making code cleaner and more efficient.
       It simplifies the process of working with threads by offering preconfigured setups like
               -> fixed thread pools
               -> cached thread pools
               -> single-threaded executors

       newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads) -
            Creates a thread pool with a fixed number of threads.
            Useful for processing a large number of tasks with a limit on threads.

       newCachedThreadPool() -
            Creates a thread pool that dynamically adjusts the number of threads based on demand.
            Good for short-lived tasks.

       newSingleThreadExecutor() -
            Creates a single thread executor.
            Ensures tasks are executed one at a time in the order they are submitted.

      newScheduledThreadPool(int corePoolSize) -
            Creates a thread pool that can schedule tasks to run after a delay or repeatedly at fixed intervals.


       What Are Executors?
         Executors are a utility class for creating and managing thread pools to handle concurrent tasks efficiently.

       Why Use Executors?
         They reduce the complexity of thread management, improve performance by reusing threads,
         and make it easier to implement concurrent programming.

      invokeAny() and invokeAll() are methods in the ExecutorService interface that allow you to execute multiple tasks
      concurrently and manage their result

      invokeAny()
        Submits a collection of tasks and returns the result of the first successfully completed task.
        The rest of the tasks are canceled if possible
        Executes all the tasks in parallel.
        As soon as one task completes successfully, it stops waiting for others and returns the result.

      invokeAll()
         Submits a collection of tasks and returns a list of Future objects, each representing the result of one task.
         Executes all tasks in parallel.
         Waits for all tasks to complete before returning the results.
         Does not cancel any tasks; it ensures all are executed.
