/*
    Daemon Thread:
        -> A daemon thread is a helper thread in Java that runs in the background.
           Its job is to support other threads or the program, like a quiet worker in the background.
           It doesn't keep the program runningâ€”if all the main (non-daemon) threads finish, the daemon thread
           will automatically stop, even if it's still working.
        -> Daemon threads terminate when all non-daemon threads in the application finish execution.
        -> Set a thread as a daemon before calling start()

    Thread Priorities
        The default priority that is assigned to a thread = 5
        The minimum priority that a thread can have = 1
        The maximum priority that a thread can have. = 10
